This is the Arduino LvGL v9 demo code from Guition for the ESP32-P4 / ESP32-C6 combo device (JC1060P470C), with minor changes for platformIO and touch and fat fingers.
Needs tick correctly fixing rather than my hacky change, but enough to play with.

This is my google drive folder for the Guition docs: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tYHF0BQpVDtNqJ_gZvNdRT5z0UJfQBPI
